This package includes various nodes that deal with remote control of an Arduino Uno using a gamepad and ROS.
Its current main purpose is to provide a personal playground to learn about mobile robotics using ROS and an Arduino with various shields, sensors and 3D printed components.
As soon as the project reaches a presentable state, the Arduino sketches will be released in a seperate package or included in this repository, also covering the hardware setup.

Roadmap
---

The following 'features' are planned to be implemented over time:

- remote controlling motors on an Arduino Uno using the Adafruit Motor Shield V1
- toggling LEDs on button press
- passing sensor data (e.g. ultra sonic)
